### About the site
It features a simple opening page with a navbar that includes a button to go straight to a mailing list/contact us form. The about page information shows the company aims and how they do it, providing some brief marketing information. The services and portfolio page displays the works offered by the business and examples of previous projects carried out. There is a contact page to submit questions or enquiries.
This website was designed to be simple as the target audience is primarily elderly people and those unable to care for their gardens, so user functionality is a must. The aim is to get the user to register their email address for the newsletter and contact us for services to be carried out if they live in the local area. There should be assurance that users will interact with the page in some way be it through the question form or viewing the portfolio.

## Website Goals

### Business Goals

-   Ease of use for elderly people, easy to navigate.
-   An easy contact process for anyone to use, and to register for a mailing list.
-   Interesting enough to click through all the webpages.
-   Promote business products and services through locality checking.
-   Use the page to advertise products as a web-shop or through referral links.

### Customer Goals

-   Find a gardening service suitable for their needs.
-   To be able to find any information about gardening or plants.
-   To see benefits to signing up to the newsletter or receiving the local services.

## User Experience

### Potential Customers

-   Mainly adults interested in gardening but it should be suitable for all ages.
-   Possible to place paid advertisements or product referrals.
-   Clients contacting for advice rather than in-person services.
-   Elderly clients should find the website easy to use, with high visibility for links and navigation.
-   Establishments looking to run gardening-based workshops.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The site features the following colours:
- Forest Green Traditional: #134611;
- India Green: #3E8914;
- Green Pigment: #3DA35D;
- Light Green: #96E072;
- Nyanza: #E8FCCF;

The colours were selected for their often associated use within the gardening industry with the exception of Nyanza, an off-green/yellow which will be used for contrast. 

![Colour scheme provided by Coolors](documentation/colourscheme.png)
*The website [Coolors](http://www.coolors.co) has been used here to preview the colour scheme and how they look together as a palette.*



### Font Family

The main logo of the site is in [‘Barlow Condensed’](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed?query=barlow&preview.text=HEARTEN%20HORTICULTURE&preview.text_type=custom), a very clear and readable font. The websites fonts will be linked from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Most of the website will use some variation of this font styled in various ways, such as italic and bold. They will be weighted between 300 and 500. The fallback font will be sans-serif.

## Images

All images used are gardening or plant related. The images will be all consistent in style and colours to fit in with the website’s themes. The homepage image should be bright and inviting, and feature real-world examples of the garden business’ work portfolio.

## Wireframes

The wireframing software [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) has been used to produce wireframe drawings and to preview the site’s layout.

## Features

### Common features on all pages

The site will have a responsive navigation bar at the top of the page, which disappears when scrolling down the page. The navigation bar has links for Home, About us, Contact us. The links are then compacted for mobile devices and tablets as a drop-down menu. The page you are currently on will be highlighted with a darker colour.
All the themes of the pages will be consistent, such as colour and font theme.
Clicking the main logo will always bring you back to the homepage.
The footer will contain social media links for facebook, twitter, Instagram and Youtube.

![Footer](/documentation/features_footer.png)

### Home Page

The main page is simply a hero image with a brief text explaining what the site is.
The links on the navigation bar are big enough that they can be noticed easily by those with visual impairments. 
The homepage establishes the feel of the site and should be very easy to navigate.
The page will also feature a 'Contact us' button below this information to quickly bring users to the 'Contact Us' page.

### About Us

![About us](/documentation/features_bio.png)


### Services and Portfolio
This page will feature a table of services offered that will scroll to a media gallery of images showing previous works carried out.
![Services table](/documentation/features_servicetable.png)
![Portfolio Gallery](/documentation/features_gallery.png)


### Contact us page
This page will have a form for contacting us. The form will require a valid name and email address.
![contact us page](/documentation/features_contactbox.png)


### Response Page
The page automatically refreshes back to homepage after 10 seconds. 
The page simply shows text upon submission of the contact form.
![Contact form Submit](/documentation/features_submit.png)


### 404 Page
The page was added as when I manually entered a url incorrected, I realised I didn't have a 404 page to redirect users back to the homepage.
The page features 1 button to redirect back to the homepage and no other clickable links for simplicity.
![404 page](/documentation/features_404.png)


### Future Features
-   Using Javascript, it should be possible to make the background images change during both the time of day, or which season we are currently in.
-   Javascript based timetable to inform customers of the flowers, fruit and vegetables that can be grown on that given day. A feature of this could  utilise IP data to provide a local weather update through a 3rd party API.
-   A feature page where the top search trending plants are listed as a 'top 10' and where to buy them at their cheapest.

* Markdown features in README.md and TESTING.md come from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) which explains the basics of markdown best practice. 

### Media
* The main logo and image links were created in Adobe Illustrator by myself 
* All photographs, images and designs on the site I have either photographed, drawn or created myself. The background images and banner images were created using [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) which utilises [Python](https://github.com/python) and the [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) framework to create machine learning images. I trained the framework with additional images of gardens and plants I have photographed myself in the past.
