### About the site
It features a simple opening page with a navbar that includes a button to go straight to a mailing list/contact us form. The about page information shows the company aims and how they do it, providing some brief marketing information. The services and portfolio page displays the works offered by the business and examples of previous projects carried out. There is a contact page to submit questions or enquiries.
This website was designed to be simple as the target audience is primarily elderly people and those unable to care for their gardens, so user functionality is a must. The aim is to get the user to register their email address for the newsletter and contact us for services to be carried out if they live in the local area. There should be assurance that users will interact with the page in some way be it through the question form or viewing the portfolio.

## Testing
### Bugs
Issue : Upon deployment to Github pages, my logo image was failing to load.
Solution : This was fixed by changing the URL to navigate from the parent directory. This was solved by reading through the CSS documentation 

Issue : When deploying to Github using the animated image png files in the CSS, the URL again failed to load correctly.
Solution : formatting the folder as '../assets/images/filename.jpeg' allows github to correctly find the parent folder allowing images to load correctly.

Issue : The 'Contact us!' button upon the homepage would not be visible when the background was moving.
Solution : Using Z-index in the CSS, the layers can be sorted by their visibility order, and numbered accordingly, the order was corrected to suit the page requirements. This method was applied to allow images to be placed on top of other images on the index.html page.

Issue: This was an aesthetic issue, but having the links in the top right corner didn't provide the accessibility of placing them adjacent to the logo in a user's line of sight when looking at a desktop screen.
Solution: Adjust design to accomodate centering the link navigation bar onscreen.



## Deployment
I deployed the website to Github pages for testing purposes. The site was deployed by following instructions found in the Github docs page.
I navigated to my site's repository, selected 'Settings', then 'Code and Automation' section, navigated to 'Pages', then 'Source' to select the main branch of the repository, upon clicking 'Save', the repository was deployed.

## Credits

Browsing on www.codepen.io has shown me a few things related to colour changing transitions with the @keyframes rule, used to create CSS animations using the CSS animation property. I have been inspired by the site relating to changing colours of text as an animation to use in my links and scrolling backgrounds. Credits to https://codepen.io/vailjoy for the lesson at (https://codepen.io/vailjoy/pen/KaqNMM) on changing colour of backgrounds, and credits to Henry Gilson https://codepen.io/henryedg on the scrolling background image lesson https://codepen.io/henryedg/pen/zYzzXON
Thanks to these lessons, I have been able to understand some features of the animation property in CSS.

### Content
* The font 'Barlow Condensed' comes from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* Instructions relating to creating a clickable image comes from [w3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), specifically a section of using images in HTML and a subsection called [Images as a link](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp)
* Instructions relating to Github deployment come from Github's docs pages [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en)

### Media
* The main logo was created in Adobe Illustrator by myself 
* All photographs, images and designs on the site I have either photographed, drawn or created by myself. The background images and banner images were created using [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) which utilises [Python](https://github.com/python) and the [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) framework to create machine learning images. I trained the engine with additional images of gardens and plants I have photographed myself.
